								<p style="word-spacing:2px;"align="justify">My interest in wireless began in high school when I witnessed the operation of a radio transmitter during an industrial trip to an AM broadcasting station. I was astonished to know that only a few hundred broadcasting stations are enough for a country. It motivated me to take communication as a major.</br></br>
			During my masters work I discovered this course that serves as an introduction to the various wireless communication systems, radio propagation, and transmission methods utilized in 4G/5G, satellite, TV, and radio transmissions, among other wireless communication systems. Engineers interested in wireless communication should take this course, which will also give students practical MATLAB experience.</br></br>
			As part of this course assignment under professor <Strong>Dr. Weifeng Su</strong>, I have simulated a communication system with additive white Gaussian noise and demodulated at the receiver for a 4-PAM modulation/demodulation in MATLAB and plotted the SER curve in terms of SNR. The symbol error rate plots obtained from simulations are compared with practical and theoretical observations. See figure 1[1] below.</br>
</p>
							 <span class="image main"><img src="images/ref1_im1.png" alt="" /></span>
							 <p style="word-spacing:2px;"align="justify">Binary PAM, 4-QAM, and 4-PAM modulation techniques were both simulated under AWGN, Rayleigh fading channels as comparison performance in terms of BER as below in Fig 2.[2] </p>
							 <span class="image main"><img src="images/ref1_im2.png" alt="" /></span>
							 <p style="word-spacing:2px;"align="justify">The bit error rate followed the same path as the symbol error rate as per the graph. The Binary PAM requires the least SNR for a fixed bit error rate and followed by the 4- QAM and then 4-PAM. SER increases with an increase in the size of the constellation because the same symbol energy has to be divided among log2M bits. Similarly, for a fixed BER, more energy is required as the size of the constellation increases to maintain similar distances among constellation points. These observations helped me understand the much higher modulation techniques like 1024 QAM and 5G communications which are currently used in industries.</br></br>

I would like to recommend this course for students interested in 5G wireless. It covers several advanced modulation techniques which are required for an industry-level position.

								<p style="font-size:33px;text-align:center">EE 598 Individual Problem</p>
								<p style="word-spacing:2px;"align="justify"> After completing Dr. Guans' 534 Principles of Networking, I approached him about working on an individual problem. He provided me with the opportunity to work on cutting-edge wireless technologies including 60 GHz millimeter wave routers. With the worldwide availability of a large swath of spectrum in the 60 GHz band for unlicensed use, we start to see an emergence of wireless technologies enabling Wi-Fi communication in this frequency band. However, compared to the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands, the 60 GHz band's signal propagation is very different.</br></br>
As part of the individual problem I have made a multipoint connection with millimeter routers. A master is configured with WPA2 security and two of the stations/slaves are connected wirelessly to the master. As in Fig. 1[1] I measured the throughput using iperf and was able to establish the socket between the routers for the data connection. 
</p>
							 <span class="image main"><img src="images/ref2_im1.png" alt="" /></span>
							 <p style="word-spacing:2px;"align="justify">Installing an IEEE80211 ad or the 60GHz wireless network system reduces cables, which are cumbersome to set up and can impose a safety risk. It can also be installed quickly and easily when compared to a traditional wired network. It may be a feature of the WiFi, and I'm glad to be able to work on this kind of project.</br></br>
Working with Dr. Guan was a great research experience all around. Students will, in my opinion, receive industry exposure and the skills required to land a core wireless communication career through this research experience.

							<article id="ref3">
								<p style="font-size:33px;text-align:center">EE620 MIMO Wireless Communication</p>
								<p style="word-spacing:2px;"align="justify"> People no longer need to connect to the internet via cables, which bind professionals to their desks. Wireless technology has enabled mobile first. Wi-Fi enables advanced application services and is a critical component in global efforts to bridge the digital divide in rural and isolated areas. I was interested in exploring advanced wireless techniques after taking the course EE538 Principles of Modern Digital Communication, so I took the course EE620 MIMO.</br></br>
WiFi also known as IEEE 802.11 WLAN, has progressed from 2 Mbps to speeds exceeding a gigabit, a 1000-fold increase in throughput. The protocol has consistently improved by adding new ones as 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6). Multi-user techniques such as multi-user Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) have been introduced to improve network efficiency and network capacity. </br></br>
Under professor Dr. Weifeng Su, as a part of this course assignment, I created four independent fading channels using Jake’s fading simulator (with M = 8 oscillators or N = 34) in MATLAB. For each channel, I generated 105 channel samples (by considering the normalized channel coefficients such that the average power of each channel coefficient is 1). Among these, I have plotted the first 500 channel samples for each of the four channels as shown in Fig. 1[1] below</p>
							 <span class="image main"><img src="images/ref3_im1.png" alt="" /></span>
							 <p style="word-spacing:2px;"align="justify"> This deterministic method still serves as a useful tool for simulating time-correlated Rayleigh fading waveforms. </br></br>
I plotted the symbol error rate vs SNR with two transmitters and one and two receivers using MATLAB as shown in the Fig. 2[2] . Regardless of SNR, the graphs show that the symbol error rate of the MIMO system with two receivers is lower than that of the MIMO system with one receiver. Thus, in terms of SER with respect to SNR, the MIMO system with two receivers clearly outperforms the MIMO system with one receiver. This observation assisted me in comprehending the significance of multiple antennas in communication.</p>
							 <span class="image main"><img src="images/ref3_im2.png" alt="" /></span>
							 <p style="word-spacing:2px;"align="justify"> Today, you need to have a solid foundational understanding of wireless communications if you want to work in the modem, Wi-Fi, or cellular industries. As systems move toward having multiple transmitter and receiver antennas, understanding how a MIMO system operates is just the beginning. I was able to understand the most recent cellular and Wi-Fi standards after taking this course and gaining a solid understanding of them. After completing this course I gained the necessary skills to obtain an internship at <strong>Apple</Strong> in the Core-Wifi team.

								<p style="font-size:33px;text-align:center">EE590 Consumer Optoelectronics</p>
								<p style="word-spacing:2px;"align="justify"> Since the invention of the wheel, humans have relied on them for travel and transportation. We have constructed bicycles, cars and trains all used to move people quickly over land. The next challenge was overcoming the vast oceans and seas, which led to the invention of ships. Even though we have achieved success in almost every mode of travel and transportation, engineers are still looking for ways to improve and optimize today's vehicles. The internet of things is helping to propel transportation forward with hovercraft. A hovercraft, also known as an air-cushion vehicle or ACV, is an amphibious craft that can travel on land, water, and other multiple surfaces. Hovercraft are flying machines that travel on a bubble of air so they don’t create a wake on the water.</br></br>
Under the direction of Dr. Ping Chin Cheng, as part of this course's final project, I developed a hovercraft. A hovercraft is propelled above the surface by one or two massive fans mounted centrally. The cockpit on the front side is where the pilot controls the vehicle. A hovercraft also has two secondary fans on the backside of the craft, as well as rudders. The propellers are primarily driven by a diesel engine in the mid-rear section. A hovercraft[1] is made up of a hull that can float in water and is carried on a cushion of air held in place by a flexible ‘skirt.' The hull is usually made of aluminum, fiberglass, plastic, or a combination of these materials.</p>
							 <span class="image main"><img src="images/ref4_im1.png" alt="" /></span>
							 <p style="word-spacing:2px;"align="justify">An Arduino board serves as the hovercraft's brain. The Arduino makes it simple to control the servo and the two brushless motors via the two electronic speed controllers, or ESCs. We used a Li-Po battery that provides around 11V to power the BLDC motors, and we can use the regulated 5V that the ESCs provide via their Battery Eliminator Circuit feature to power the Arduino. We used a parallel battery connector splitter, type XT60, to connect the two ESCs to a single battery.</p>
							 <span class="image main"><img src="images/ref4_im2.png" alt="" /></span>
							 <p style="word-spacing:2px;"align="justify">The incoming data from the transmitter in Fig. 2[2]  is read and used to control the servo and brushless motors. So, joystick incoming data ranging from 0 to 255 are converted into values ranging from 0 to 50, and these values are used to control the position of the servo. The claimed 180-degree rotation was not realized; instead, we got about 120 degrees by overloading the signal beyond the stated "acceptable" range. We can achieve a maximum rotation of 140 degrees using the servo. Using the same method, we control the brushless motors with ESCs.</br></br>
It was a fantastic experience to create a system from scratch and then ultimately see it function. Working on a project shows your grasp of the course, and you can only figure out where you went wrong after breaking and making your code a hundred times. All of the groups had the chance to present their work to the class on the last day of class, and I was astounded to see all of the incredible ideas. I was pleased to see that the two groups built their projects with the idea that the Internet of Things will play a significant role in the future, especially in transportation.
